# SROC Charging Module API Docs

> WIP replacement for how we currently manage our OpenAPI spec in [sroc-service-team](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-service-team)

Home of the OpenAPI spec that documents the funcationality of the [Charging Module API](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-charging-module-api). It was built from the [swagger-github-pages template](https://github.com/peter-evans/swagger-github-pages) which adds the ability to view and interact with the documentation using GitHub pages.

> This README is also a work in progress whilst we figure out how best to setup this repo.
